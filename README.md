### Goodreads

A project realised for the course Big Data (academic year 2021/22).

The goal of this project is to analyse the Goodreads dataset [link](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph). After a preliminary analysis that explored the dataset, we tried to highlight any possible pattern to how users reviews their books and examin how good is Goodreads recommendation system.

To sum up, we found out that on Goodreads:

- the books are mainly in English and in paperback format;
- most books do not belong to series;
- the series are mainly composed of 2 or 3 volumes;
- most books have an average rating between 3 and 4 stars;
- the most reviewed author is J. K. Rowling;
- out of more than 800k registered users, only 300k have read at least 100 books and half of these have left between 0 and 4 reviews;
- on average, recommended books get positive ratings from users.
